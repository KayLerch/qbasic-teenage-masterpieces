# My teenage Qbasic adventures (anno 1998)
My historically valueable Qbasic games from 1998. All of them scripted on my 80386 after school. I found them on an old hard-disk and thought it would be fun to not only share it but to preserve it for my kids.

Back in the days I learned a lot from a computer magazine called PC Games. An attached CD-ROM contained games made by readers of the magazine. So I started to replicate code, altered it in some way and learned from the strange effects that I caused. At some day I started writing own games and installed them on all PCs in my school lab. I was so proud to see how students played my games instead of paying attention to the class.
